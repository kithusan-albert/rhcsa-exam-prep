### 1. **Linux Directory Structure and File Systems:**

    File systems contain files and subdirectories.

</p>

    Files system hold static data, dynamic or variable information
        - Static data refers to file content that remains unchanged unless modified explicitly.
        - Dynamic or variable data refers to file content that is modified and updated as required by system processes.
        - Static diretories normally contain command, configuration files, librarym routines, kernel files, device files, etc.
        - Dynamic directories contain log files, status files, temporary file, etc.
        
    The forward slash ( / ) is used as a directory separator in directory path.

    
### 2. **File System:**

>  **Directories**

    /ect : This directory holds system configuration files.
    /root : This is the default home directory location of the root user.
    /mnt : This is the directory used to mount file systems temporarily. 
    /boot : Boot file system contains the Linux kernel, boot support files, and boot configuration files. 
    /home : Home file system is to store user home directories and other user contents.
    /opt : Used to hold additional software that may need to be installed on the system. A subdirectory is created for each installed software

>  **UNIX System Resources Directory (/usr)**

    /usr: usr contains most of the system files.
        - /usr/bin : The binary directory contains crucial user executable commands.
        - /usr/sbin : Commands that are required at system boot, and those that require the root user privileges in order to run are stored in the system binary directory.
        - /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 : Contains shared library routines required by many commands and programs located in the /usr/bin and /usrs/sbin directories, other application and programs for their sucessful installation and operation.
        - /usr/lib directory also stores system initialization and service management programs.
        - /usr/lib64 contains 64-bit shared library routines.

    /usr/include : This directory contains header files for C language.
    /usr/local : This directory serves as a system administrator repository for storing custom commands and tools. 
        - /usr/local/bin contains executables
        - /usr/local/etc hold configurations files
        - /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib64 holds libray routines. 

    /usr/share : This directory serves as the location for manual pages, documentation, sample templates, configuration file, etc., that may be shared with other Linux platforms. 

    /usr/src : This directory is used to store source code.
    
>  **Variable Directory (/var)**

    /var : This directory contains data that frequently changes while the system is operational. Files in this directory contain log, status, spool, lock and other dynamic data. 
        - /var/log storage for most log files, such as system logs, boot logs, user logs, failed user logs, installation logs, cron logs, mail logs, etc. 
        - /var/opt stores log, status, and other variable data files for additional software installed in /opt.
        - /var/spool holds print jobs, cron jobs, mail messages, and other queued items before being sent out to their intended destinations.
        - /var/tmp : large temporary files or temporary files that need to exist for longer periods of time than what is typically allowed in /tmp. Survive system reboots and automatically deleted if not accessed or modified for 30 days.

>  **Temporary Directory (/tmp)**       

    /tmp : Is a repository for temporary files. Survive system reboots and automatically deleted if not accessed or modified for 10 days. 
    
>  **Device File Systems (/dev) - Virtual**

    /dev directory, is used to store device nodes for physical     hardware and virtual devices. The Linux kernel communicates with these devices through corresponding device nodes located here.
        These devices are automatically created and deleted by the udevd service (a Linux service for dynamic device management) as necessary.
        
>  **System File Systems (/sys) - Virtual**       

    /sys directory, stores  information about hardware devices, drivers, and some kernel features. This information is used by the kernel to load necessary support for the devices, create device nodes in /dev, and configure the devices. The file system is auto-maintained. 
    
>  **Procfs File Systems (/proc) - Virtual**

    The Procfs (process file system) is used to maintain information about the current state of running kernel. This includes the details for current hardware configuration and status information on CPU, memeory, disks, partitioning, file systemm networkingm running processes , ect.
    
    /run and its subdirectories is a virtual file system for storing data for processes running on the system.
