**Linux Directory Structure and File Systems:**

    - File systems contain files and subdirectories.
    - Files sytems hold static data, dynamic or varialbe information
        - Static data refers to file content that remains unchanged unless modified explicitly.
        - Dynamic or variable data refers to file content that is modified and updated as required by system processes.
        - Static diretories normally contain command, configuration files, librarym routines, kernel files, device files, etc.
        - Dynamic directories contain log files, status files, temporary file, etc.
        
    - The forward slash ( / ) is used as a directory separator in directory path.
