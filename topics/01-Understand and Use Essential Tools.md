### 1. **Linux Directory Structure and File Systems:**

    - File systems contain files and subdirectories.
    
    - Files sytems hold static data, dynamic or variable information
        - Static data refers to file content that remains unchanged unless modified explicitly.
        - Dynamic or variable data refers to file content that is modified and updated as required by system processes.
        - Static diretories normally contain command, configuration files, librarym routines, kernel files, device files, etc.
        - Dynamic directories contain log files, status files, temporary file, etc.
        
    - The forward slash ( / ) is used as a directory separator in directory path.

    
### 2. **Root File System:**

    - /ect : directory holds system configuration files.
    - /root : This is the default home directory location of the root user.
    - /mnt : This is the directory used to mount file systems temporarily. 
    - /boot : Boot file system contains the Linux kernel, boot support files, and boot configuration files. 
    - /home : Home file system is to store user home directories and other user contents.
    - /opt : Used to hold additional software that may need to be installed on the system. A subdirectory is created for each installed software
    - /usr:
